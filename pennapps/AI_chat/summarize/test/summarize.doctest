Overview
~~~~~~~~

Summarizers provide a short summary or abstract from a longer document.

	>>> import summarize

SimpleSummarizer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
A SimpleSummarizer makes a summary by using sentences with the most frequent 
words
	
	>>> ss = summarize.SimpleSummarizer()
	>>> input = "NLTK is a python library for working human-written text. Summarize is a package that uses NLTK to create summaries."
	>>> ss.summarize(input, 1)
	'NLTK is a python library for working human-written text.'
	
You can specify any number of sentenecs in the summary as you like.

	>>> input = "NLTK is a python library for working human-written text. Summarize is a package that uses NLTK to create summaries. A Summariser is really cool. I don't think there are any other python summarisers."
	>>> ss.summarize(input, 2)
	"NLTK is a python library for working human-written text. I don't think there are any other python summarisers."

Unlike the original algorithm from Classifier4J, this summarizer works
correctly with punctuation other than periods:

	>>> input = "NLTK is a python library for working human-written text! Summarize is a package that uses NLTK to create summaries."
	>>> ss.summarize(input, 1)
	'NLTK is a python library for working human-written text!'
